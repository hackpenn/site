92% of attendees were attending their first hackathon. They created 40+ innovative projects. 41% were first-time coders, & 96% said they‚Äôd continue after the event.

Though technology opportunities are abound on the coasts, we set a new precedent of what making looks like for young people‚Äîfrom the snowy woods of central PA.
